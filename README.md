# MIE-TCN
PyTorch Source code for "Estimating Lower Extremity Multi-Joint Kinematics with One IMU Sensor via Attention-based Temporal Convolutional Neural Network", Under Review.

Coming Soon ! :relaxed: :relaxed: :relaxed:

## How to run this project
This project contains two main file as follows:

### Step 1: Compare the estimation results of different deep learning methods
`python main_dl.py 
- Here, you can run the proposed model and other models.
  - Switch the model name
  - Switch the dataset name

### Step 2: Compare the estimation results of different machine learning methods
`python main_ml.py 
- Here, you can run different machine learning algorithms.
